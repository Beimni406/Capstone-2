# 🍕 PIZZA-licious

## Description of the Project

PIZZA-licious is a Java console application that simulates a simple pizza ordering system.  
It allows users to create and manage their own pizza orders by adding pizzas, drinks, and side items such as garlic knots.  
The app calculates totals, displays a receipt on the screen, and saves it automatically as a `.txt` file on the computer.  

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation while building a realistic ordering system.  
The intended users are beginner programmers or anyone who wants to understand how a basic ordering system works through a console interface.

- As a **user**, I want my receipt saved automatically so I can keep a copy of my order details.  
- As a **developer**, I want to apply Java OOP principles to understand inheritance, composition, and file handling.
