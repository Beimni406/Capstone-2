# 🍕 PIZZA-licious

## Description of the Project

PIZZA-licious is a Java console application that allows users to create and manage their own pizza orders.  
The program lets users add pizzas with regular and premium toppings, select drinks, and include sides like garlic knots.  
After the order is completed, the system automatically calculates the total and saves a receipt file to the computer.  

The purpose of this project is to apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.  
It was developed as part of the **Year Up Java Focus Academy** to help students gain hands-on experience building real-world Java applications.

## User Stories

- As a **customer**, I want to add pizzas, drinks, and sides so that I can create a full order.  
- As a **customer**, I want to see the total price of my order so that I know how much it costs.  
- As a **user**, I want my order to be saved as a receipt so that I can keep a copy of it.  
- As a **developer**, I want to use OOP principles so that the project structure is clean and easy to understand.

## Future Work

- Add a menu system for selecting pizza sizes, crust types, and toppings interactively.  
- Add the ability to remove or edit items before checkout.  
- Add coupon or discount code options.  
- Improve visuals with a JavaFX graphical interface.  
- Connect to a small database to store customer orders.
